```

### Key Components

#### 1. Web Application Layer
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Middleware**: Request/response filtering and authentication
- **Form Requests**: Input validation and authorization
- **Resources**: API response transformation

#### 2. Business Logic Layer
- **Services**: Encapsulate business rules and operations
- **Repositories**: Data access abstraction
- **Events & Listeners**: Decoupled event handling
- **Jobs & Queues**: Background task processing

#### 3. Data Layer
- **Models**: Eloquent ORM for database interaction
- **Migrations**: Database schema version control
- **Seeders**: Test and initial data population
- **Factories**: Model instance generation for testing

#### 4. Infrastructure Layer
- **Docker Environment**: Containerized development setup
- **Nginx Configuration**: Web server and reverse proxy
- **Redis Cache**: Session storage and application caching
- **MySQL Database**: Primary data storage

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. **Setup**: `docker-compose up -d`
2. **Dependencies**: `composer install`
3. **Database**: `php artisan migrate --seed`
4. **Testing**: `php artisan test`
5. **Assets**: `npm install && npm run dev`

### Key Development Commands
```bash
# Application commands
php artisan serve
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan test

# Docker commands
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec app bash
docker-compose logs -f app

# Package management
composer install
composer update
composer dump-autoload
```
