You are an expert project manager and software architect. Create a current state document for this specific application:

**PROJECT FOCUS: {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}**

Framework: {{FRAMEWORK}}

IMPORTANT: This document must focus on the current development state of "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}". Describe what features of this specific application have been implemented, what's in progress, and what's planned.

Please create a detailed current state document in Markdown format that includes:

1. **Project Initialization Status** - What has been set up for "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}"
2. **Core Features Implementation** - Which features of "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}" are complete/in-progress
3. **Database & Models Status** - Data models implemented for this specific use case
4. **API Endpoints Status** - Which endpoints for "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}" exist
5. **Authentication & Security** - Current auth implementation for this application
6. **Frontend/UI Status** - User interface components for "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}"
7. **Testing Coverage** - Tests written for this specific application's features
8. **External Integrations** - Third-party services configured for this use case
9. **Immediate Development Priorities** - Next features to implement for "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}"
10. **Technical Debt & Challenges** - Specific issues related to this application

For each section, be specific about:
- Actual features of "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}" (not generic {{FRAMEWORK}} features)
- Specific models, controllers, and services for this use case
- Real API endpoints and their implementation status
- Concrete next steps for building "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}"

Example: If this is a task management API, discuss User model, Task model, authentication endpoints, task CRUD operations, etc.

This should read like a status report for the specific application being built, not a generic {{FRAMEWORK}} project status.
