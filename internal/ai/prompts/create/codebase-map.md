You are an expert software architect. Create a comprehensive codebase map specifically for this application:

**PROJECT FOCUS: {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}**

Framework: {{FRAMEWORK}}

IMPORTANT: This codebase map must be specifically tailored to "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}". Describe the actual files, directories, and code organization needed to implement this specific application, not generic {{FRAMEWORK}} structure.

Please create a detailed codebase map in Markdown format that includes:

1. **Project-Specific Directory Structure** - Folders and files needed for "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}"
2. **Core Application Files** - Controllers, models, services specific to this use case
3. **Data Layer Design** - Models, repositories, and database structure for "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}"
4. **API Layer Organization** - Routes, controllers, and middleware for this application
5. **Business Logic Components** - Services and classes that implement "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}" functionality
6. **Configuration Files** - Settings and config specific to this application's needs
7. **Testing Structure** - Test organization for this specific application
8. **Integration Points** - Files handling external services for "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}"

For each major component, explain:
- How it contributes to implementing "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}"
- Specific classes, methods, or functions that would exist
- Data models and relationships for this use case
- API endpoints and their purposes

Include concrete examples like:
- Specific model names (e.g., Task, User, Project)
- Actual controller methods (e.g., createTask, assignTask)
- Real API endpoints (e.g., POST /tasks, GET /tasks/{id})
- Database tables and relationships

This should be a technical blueprint for implementing "{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}" using {{FRAMEWORK}}.
